There are many ways in order to archieve ones goal, one way no one get to ever try is to set a time stamp in which it is faster than their lifetime, in which case i might be delusional. I love it, although not all, like literally but it is a fun experience, 
Many reasons:
1.no sleep
2.failure to stop low level activities from taking up a long time (TV, youtube, twitter)
3.not enough good socialization
