<h1>highly real predictions</h1>
----------
What is a good prediction, soemtimes a realistic one. but what is a realistic scale look like and something that's not?
Steven pinker made a bet years ago predicting a bioterror or bioerror case will not cause 100,000 deaths in next 2 years.
His reasoning was great, really! but now we all knows what happeneded, 3 mil deaths(just for comparison 200,000 death for atomic nukes).
1. If senario is imaginable, it's probable.
Great mind opener(lol)
2. never happened before, chances of happening then is weaker
3. those with high iQ will be less evil
but it seem the ability to destroy the world goes down 1 iQ ever few decades due to easy access of knowledge nad material for terror
