# A group of people believing in a lie doesn't not make that lie the truth.
if you had your own thought upon the situation, thinking it's more truthful that theirs, keep them, maybe speak them if found valuable
so what is truth? if your truth is based on fine evidences, logical reasonings comparing to those based on lies, trash evidences.
self explanatory, but sometimes my brain are wired to falsely find group think efficent
