# What does university and colleges give you?
- community(socialize, networking,...)
- knowledge
- certification of having those knowledge

There are many more but those are what people find the most values out of being in them. What would be the case for having a replacement for all those 3. 
I'll have the second one mapped out first, Knowledge is vast is has never seen a better day for its existence in this era, still there are certain quality
of being letured or seeing talented professor talking infront of a board that people find amusing. There's no denial of the purpose of being a teacher, it
is to spread knowledge. But i couldn't understand why those lectures aren't recorded and published online, is it because they haven't find the use of it or
there's no commercial incentives that are easily imaginable in order for more professor to open course their lectures, assignment and test. We go to school
everyday to learn, at the end of week to be tested and at the end of year to be gettinga certification. if all of those can be open coursed (sure make the
assignments open coursing delay by the in person time stance to avoid cheating (maybe)) But if the course is fully open including assignment and test, 
everyone around te world can access to this knowledge and be just like the student in school.

Certification of knowledge is easy, every year or so, set up a booth somewhere in the cities to let people who want certification of knowledge of certain field 
to get it. We'll test them rigorously and if they exceed the knowledge test, we can then bring them over to next stage of actual experimenting. Note that this
will be paid by those people who signed up for it, therefore it is scallable and i don't think the fees will be so high that it will deter anyone from trying to
receieve that certificate.

THe community of college has been described as one of the finest, although in today standard i'd say that it is quite monolistic, as liberal and certain toxic/herd- like
cultures that are falling for societal scam everyday is not useful. Not all but so much visible.
